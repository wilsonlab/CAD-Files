This repository contains the source files used by the Wilson lab for manufacturing implantable hyperdrives.  
We hope other peope/labs will find these files useful, although they are provided AS IS and without any type of warrany.

These contents of this repository were designed using [SolidWorks](http://www.solidworks.com/). You'll need a copy of
SolidWorks if you want to make any changes to the `.sldprt` files.  If you are simply interested in printing your own 
drives the `.stl` files are all you need.
