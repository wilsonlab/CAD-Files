This repository contains the source files used by the Wilson lab for manufacturing implantable hyperdrives.  
We hope other peope/labs will find these files useful, although they are provided AS IS and without any type of warrany.

These contents of this repository were designed using [SolidWorks](http://www.solidworks.com/). You'll need a copy of
SolidWorks if you want to make any changes to the `.sldprt` files.  However, if you only want to print our drives then
the `.stl` files are all you need.

###Files in this repository include:

* [Rat microdrives](https://github.com/wilsonlab/CAD-Files/tree/master/solidworks/rat-drives) assemblies
* [Mouse microdrives](https://github.com/wilsonlab/CAD-Files/tree/master/solidworks/mouse-drives) assemblies
* [The files referenced](https://github.com/wilsonlab/CAD-Files/tree/master/solidworks/rat-drives/jove) in our [Jove Publications](http://www.jove.com/search?authors=Matthew+Wilson%2C+Massachusetts+Institute+of+Technology)
* [Other](https://github.com/wilsonlab/CAD-Files/tree/master/solidworks/other) files such as top-piece molds and parts used for building assemblies in SolidWorks

### File Locations
 * Editable source files are found in [solidworks/](https://github.com/wilsonlab/CAD-Files/tree/master/solidworks)
 * Ready to print files are found in [stl/](https://github.com/wilsonlab/CAD-Files/tree/master/stl)
 * Machine drawings used to manufacture our top-piece screws can be found in [drawings/](https://github.com/wilsonlab/CAD-Files/tree/master/drawing)
